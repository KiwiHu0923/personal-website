                Hi, welcome to my personal website. Iâ€™m William. 
                I obtained my bachelor degree and master degree in Biology from
                <a class="about__link-item" href="https://ibs.ntu.edu.tw/home.jsp?lang=en">National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>
                and 
                <a class="about__link-item" href="https://www.bio.ncku.edu.tw/english">National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)</a>
                in Taiwan.
                And now I am a MSCS student at 
                <a class="about__link-item" href="https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/programs/masters/msprograms/computer-science/ms-cs-scientists-engineers/">University of Southern California (USC)</a>
                in the United States, focusing on learning data science and software engineering. 
                I'll be sharing my CS-related projects with you all here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a broad interest in both biology and computer science, and I hope to pursue a career that combines these two
                fields (e.g., AI, computational biology, bioinformatics...) and having fun of learning new knowledges.
            </p>
